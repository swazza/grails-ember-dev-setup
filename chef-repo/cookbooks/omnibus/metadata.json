For more information on the Release Engineering team's contribution, triage, and release process, please consult the [CHEF Release Engineering OSS Management Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/opscode.com/document/d/1oJB0vZb_3bl7_ZU2YMDBkMFdL-EWplW1BJv_FXTUOzg/edit).\n\nRequirements\n------------\nThis cookbook requires Chef 11.0.0+.\n\nFor a full list of supported platforms and external cookbook requirements, please see the `metadata.rb` file at the root of the cookbook.\n\n\nRecipes\n-------\nThe default recipe is the main entrypoint for the cookbook and does the following:\n\n- Ensures all required Omnibus-related directories are created and owned by the build user.\n- Ensures a sane build tool-chain is installed and configured (using the [build-essential](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/build-essential) cookbook)\n- Ensures git is installed (using the [git](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/git) cookbook)\n- Includes a platform-specific recipe to apply additional tweaks as appropriate.\n\nAll other recipes should be treated as \"private\" and are not meant to be used individually. They only exist to support the `default` recipe.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n| Attribute     | Default              | Description                           |\n|---------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| `build_user`  | `omnibus`            | The user to perform the Omnibus build |\n| `install_dir` | `/opt/omnibus`       | The directory to install Omnibus      |\n| `cache_dir`   | `/var/cache/omnibus` | The cache directory for Omnibus       |\n\n\nUsage\n-----\nInclude the `omnibus::default` recipe in your node's run list and override the cookbook's default attributes as desired. At the very least you will want to override `node['omnibus']['install_dir']` to match the installation directory of your Omnibus project.\n\n\nTesting\n-------\nYou can run the tests in this cookbook using Rake:\n\n```text\nrake integration  # Run Test Kitchen integration tests\nrake style        # Run all style checks\nrake style:chef   # Lint Chef cookbooks\nrake style:ruby   # Run Ruby style checks\nrake travis:ci    # Run tests on Travis\n```\n\n\nLicense & Authors\n-----------------\n- Author: Seth Vargo (<sethvargo@gmail.com>)\n- Author: Yvonne Lam (<yvonne@getchef.com>)\n- Author: Seth Chisamore (<schisamo@getchef.com>)\n- Author: Stephen Delano (<stephen@getchef.com>)\n\n```text\nCopyright 2012-2014, Chef Software, Inc.
